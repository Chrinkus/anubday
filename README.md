Command line birthday reminder written in C

This project will serve to expand my skill with C and some of its common libraries. Challenges to solve:
- store persistent data with SQLite
- process command line arguments
- handle dates including today, past and future days

There will also be some design considerations to tackle:
- easy to use interface
- consistent with other command line interfaces
- how best to display output
